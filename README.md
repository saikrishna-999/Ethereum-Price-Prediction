# Ethereum-Price-Prediction


📌 Project Overview
-------------------
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the future price of Ethereum (ETH) using historical price data. Implemented in Python with Jupyter Notebooks, it explores various models to forecast Ethereum''s price movements.

🛠️ Technologies Used
--------------------
- Python          : Programming language for data analysis and modeling.
- Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for development and visualization.
- Pandas          : Data manipulation and analysis library.
- NumPy           : Numerical computing library.
- Matplotlib/Seaborn : Data visualization libraries.
- Scikit-learn    : Machine learning library for model building.


🚀 How to Run
-------------
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/saikrishna-999/Ethereum-Price-Prediction.git
   
   cd Ethereum-Price-Prediction

3. Install required libraries:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   jupyter notebook AI_ML_PROJECT.ipynb

5. Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute the analysis and model training.

📊 Sample Output
----------------
- Line plots of Ethereum''s historical closing prices.
