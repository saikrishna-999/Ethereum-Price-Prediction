# Ethereum-Price-Prediction


📌 Project Overview
-------------------
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the future price of Ethereum (ETH) using historical price data. Implemented in Python with Jupyter Notebooks, it explores various models to forecast Ethereum''s price movements.

🛠️ Technologies Used
--------------------
- Python          : Programming language for data analysis and modeling.
- Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for development and visualization.
- Pandas          : Data manipulation and analysis library.
- NumPy           : Numerical computing library.
- Matplotlib/Seaborn : Data visualization libraries.
- Scikit-learn    : Machine learning library for model building.
